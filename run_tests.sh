# Run the SQLLogic (haybarn) suite in test/sql/ against the Python worker, using the
# haybarn DuckDB distribution's unittest runner (which loads the `vgi` extension from the
# community repository).
#
# NOTE: the live-invariant asserts fetch from Schwab in-process through curl_cffi's Chrome
# TLS impersonation (the only client that passes Schwab's Akamai front). That requires `uv`
# on PATH (to resolve the worker's environment) and outbound network to
# www.schwabassetmanagement.com. The DESCRIBE asserts are bind-only (no network) and always run.
#
# Prerequisites (one-time):
#   uv tool install haybarn-unittest                      # the DuckDB unittest binary
#   echo "INSTALL vgi FROM community;" | uvx haybarn-cli  # install the vgi extension
#   uv sync --extra dev                                   # the worker's Python environment
